I am a researcher at the Institute of Intelligent Vehicles, Tongji University. My research primarily focuses on the field of autonomous driving, with a particular emphasis on exploring the potential of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to enhance perception, reasoning, and decision-making in complex driving scenarios. 

Recently, my work centers on constructing high-quality datasets and benchmarks to evaluate and train multimodal autonomous driving models. I developed the Interactive Enhanced Driving Dataset (IEDD) by extracting and processing complex interaction scenarios from large-scale datasets such as Waymo, nuPlan, and Lyft. Building upon this, I created IEDD-VQA, a synthetic multimodal benchmark dataset comprising Bird's-Eye View (BEV) videos and structured question-answer pairs derived from trajectory data. Furthermore, I actively explore efficient model adaptation, including fine-tuning the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct model using LoRA on the IEDD-VQA dataset. My latest research findings regarding these datasets are currently being prepared for submission to [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20575).

On the technical side, I am proficient in Python and possess extensive hands-on experience with deep learning frameworks and libraries, including PyTorch, PEFT, transformers, and vLLM. I am passionate about open-source contributions and advancing the field of intelligent vehicles.
